# Ants

This was originally supposed to be a simulation of ant/bug behavior as a study of low level artificial intelligence (ie bug intelligence). Eventually this turned into a pathing algorithm practice using the A* algorithm. I realized that I wasn't moving towards the goal of the project so I moved the pathing stuff over to a new project.

I will eventually come back to the orignal idea for this project though.
